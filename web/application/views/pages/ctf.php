<h1> Hello, and welcome to GeekcampSG's CTF!  </h1>

<h2> What do I do?  </h2>

<ul>
<li> Capture the flags. Your goal is to get to the server, and capture each flag. </li>
<li> Flags are stored in the home directory of your target user, in a file named <b>flag</b>. </li>
<li> Your first target is the flag of user level1@ctf.geekcamp.sg. </li>
<li> When you capture a flag, send a <b>plaintext</b> email to <a href="mailto:ctf@rahul.ag">ctf@rahul.ag</a>. </li>
<li> Once you have the final flag, find <b><a href="http://geekcamp.sg/pages/team">Rahul</a></b> and give him the flag code <b>on a piece of paper</b>, <b>in person</b>. </li>
<li> You <b>will</b> be required to show your method of attack for each flag. </li>
<li> The first person to capture the last flag, or the person with the most flags &amp; the best solution at 1800 hrs wins. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Rules </h2>
