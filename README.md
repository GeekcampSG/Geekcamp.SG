Geekcamp.SG
===========

Geekcamp.SG's code

The code could probably be used for other unconferences that allow for user submission and voting before the unconference happens. Making it open source so that others can use, but not customising alot because this is a bare MVP for Geekcamp.SG. So you'll probably need to hack abit of stuff to make it work for your unconference (Logos, partners, email-to address). 

Anyone wanting to submit pull requests are welcomed to do so :) Would appreciate if anyone spots security flaws to at least come forward and let me know about it too.

Stack: PHP/Codeigniter and MongoDB

MongoDB chosen because I already have a HA infrastructure for it readily available.
